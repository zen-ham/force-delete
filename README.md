# Force-delete

Adds "Force Delete" to the right click context menu on windows. Simply download the .zip in the release, and run "Add_Force_Delete_to_context_menu.exe" to get started, then you can right click any file or folder and click "Force Delete".

It's a python script (compiled to .exe, the source is available but you will have to compile it yourself before it works) to forcefully delete a file or folder, even if that file/folder is being accessed in some way by an external or internal process, or is owned by a different user or owned by the system.

Requires admin each time to run.
